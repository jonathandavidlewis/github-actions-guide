A guide for creating readable, maintainable, secure, efficient github actions

## Principles

### This guide is based on the following principles:

* Workflows are easy for other developers to read, review, and maintain.

* Workflows follow consistent patterns and standards, making it easier for the team to understand and reuse them.

* Workflows are optimized to minimize resource usage and reduce costs.

* Workflows follow the principle of least privilege to enhance security.

* Workflows provide clear logging and feedback, making it easy to track what's happening and quickly diagnose issues.

* Workflows use components like scripts and actions that can be tested independently.
